# CollisionSimulation

A 2D physics simulation that visually demonstrates elastic collisions between two blocks of different masses. Designed to explore momentum, energy conservation, and Pi approximation concepts.
<br>

## üí° What it does

- Simulates 1D elastic collisions between two blocks with realistic momentum and energy transfer
- Supports toggling simulation with spacebar or mouse click
- Logs velocity, time, KE, and momentum to a CSV file for analysis
- Displays collision count and elapsed time during simulation
- Optional sound effects on collision
